# DataScienceProject-HousePricePredictionModel

### Project Overview:
This data science project focuses on predicting house prices using three different machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The project utilizes a dataset containing various features of houses, such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with their corresponding prices. By training models on this data, we aim to build accurate predictive models for estimating house prices.

### Instructions:
Clone the project repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/RutujaBalkrishnaGhate/DataScienceProject-HousePricePredictionModel.git

Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory in sequential order to perform data exploration, model development, and evaluation.

The trained models will be saved in the models/ directory.

Use the trained models to make predictions on new data by running the corresponding notebook or using the pre-trained models directly.

The prediction outputs will be stored in the predictions/ directory.

Modify the code, experiment with different algorithms, and explore additional features to improve the model's performance.

Note:
Ensure that you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed.
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies and avoid conflicts.
The provided dataset is for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with your own dataset, but ensure that it has the necessary features and target variable.
